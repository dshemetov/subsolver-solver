"""Get Subsolver Puzzles.

Will download all the puzzles from Subsolver and save them to puzzles.txt (one
per line). (Requires a number of dependencies, you're likely better off just
copying puzzles manually from the website.)

Usage:

uv run pull.py

Description:

It's not a simple HTTP GET because the puzzle text is rendered with Javascript
and requires a keypress to reveal the text. We got around this with Selenium.
This code uses Firefox, though you can probably modify it to whatever browser
you have.

If you're working remotely (via SSH), you will need to use the Selenium server.
To install:

1. Install Java:
    sudo apt install default-jre
2. Download Selenium server:
    wget https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/releases/download/selenium-4.15.0/selenium-server-4.15.0.jar
3. Start Selenium server:
    java -jar selenium-server-4.15.0.jar standalone
4. Set REMOTE_SSH = True below.
